# **Overview**<br />
This is game for my portfolio. It's a classic Snake game with the opponent which also hunts for apples and trying to eat the player's snake, if his snake is big enough.

## **How to play?**<br />
When you start the game, you'll see the Menu. You need to collect 5 apples more and than to eat the Bot snake for win. The game has two ways to lose. The First way - you play until you hit your part (you can go through the walls). And be careful, if your snake is smaller than 5 apples, you can be eaten by the opponent!
